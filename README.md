# Human-Pose-Estimation-using-Machine-Learning


This project focuses on Human Pose Estimation (HPE) using machine learning techniques to enhance training methodologies in yoga centers and sports academies. By employing deep learning frameworks such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), this system provides accurate, real-time tracking of human body movements to improve efficiency, safety, and overall performance during physical activities.


# Introduction
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust model capable of single and multi-person pose estimation. Applications include:

1. Real-time feedback for yoga practitioners to ensure proper postures.
2. Technique analysis for athletes in sports academies.
3 .Injury prevention by identifying improper movements.

# Methodology
1. Input Capture: Video frames are extracted using high-resolution cameras.
2. Pose Estimation: Models like OpenPose or AlphaPose are used for detecting body keypoints.
3. Post-Processing: Techniques such as temporal smoothing are applied for enhanced accuracy.
4. Feedback: A user interface displays results and recommends improving techniques.
