## About the Project

Human Pose Estimation (HPE) is a computer vision technique that predicts the positions of key body joints (e.g., elbows, knees, shoulders) from visual data. This project uses state-of-the-art machine learning models to achieve real-time and highly accurate pose detection, enhancing training methodologies in yoga centers, sports academies, and more.

## Features

- Real-time detection of body keypoints.
- Supports single-person and multi-person pose estimation.
- Flexible input sources (images, videos, webcam).
- Provides feedback for posture correction and injury prevention.
- Easy integration with downstream applications.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Models**: Pre-trained models like OpenPose, PoseNet, AlphaPose, or custom-trained models.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or later
- Git
- pip or conda

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/deepu-sbc/AICTE-INTERNSHIP-HUMAN-POSE-ESTIMATION.git
   cd AICTE-INTERNSHIP-HUMAN-POSE-ESTIMATION
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

Run the Streamlit application to visualize the Human Pose Estimation process.

1. Save the Streamlit code in a file named `app.py`.
2. Start the app using the command:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

The app includes options to:
- Upload and process images or videos.
- View real-time pose estimation via webcam (upcoming feature).

---

## Dataset

This project uses the **COCO Dataset** for training and evaluation.  
- The COCO dataset provides annotations for 17 human body keypoints.
- You can download the dataset from the [COCO official website](https://cocodataset.org/).

## Model Details

The pose estimation models utilize advanced architectures like OpenPose or PoseNet:  
- **Input**: RGB images of size \( X \times Y \).  
- **Output**: Heatmaps for key body points.  

### Steps in Pose Estimation
1. **Input Preprocessing**:  
   Resize and normalize input images to match model requirements.
2. **Pose Detection**:  
   Detect body keypoints using a pre-trained model.
3. **Post-Processing**:  
   Smooth keypoint predictions and connect them to form a skeletal structure.
4. **Visualization**:  
   Overlay the skeleton on the input image or video for output visualization.
